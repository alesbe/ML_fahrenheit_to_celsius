# Fahrenheit to celsius converter with machine learning
This is my first machine learning project. It converts fahrenheit to celsius without knowing the formula. The neural network uses a [sequential model](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/sequential_model), one of the most simples. It takes one input tensor and one output tensor.

## Model 1
The first model uses an input layer with one tensor and an output layer with one tensor.

## Model 2
The second model uses an input layer with one tensor, two hidden layers with three tensors each one and an input layer with one output layer.
